model:
  name: "SARIMA"
  # SARIMA(p, d, q) x (P, D, Q, s)
  # p=1: one autoregressive lag
  # d=1: first-order differencing for stationarity
  # q=1: one moving average term
  order: [1, 1, 1]
  # P=1: one seasonal AR lag
  # D=1: one seasonal differencing
  # Q=1: one seasonal MA term
  # s=288: seasonal period = 1 day at 5-min resolution (288 steps)
  seasonal_order: [1, 1, 1, 288]
